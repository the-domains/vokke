            <title><![CDATA[A long Journey]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A long Journey</h1><p>The long trek up Mt. Washington in New Hampshire was worth the 7 hours of climbing and hiking when I came upon this breathtaking view.  As the clouds filled the cold sky i sat and listened to the sound of the earth singing.   The sound of wind, water, and earth all in sync.  the colors of fall filling the forest and painting a masterpiece of amazement.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/5287ec4b9fae27777c6fcb0dd5f67856ff260cc1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[An enlightened moment]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An enlightened moment</h1><p>It was roughly 8 years ago as i walked out onto the beach on the Pacific northwest coast of Washington state.   I had to trek 2 miles through the tall magnificent forests of the Olympic Mountains.  As i stepped foot onto the beach i was in awe.  Mainly of the extreme tide drop...  litterally 10-15 feet.  It was like nothing i had ever seen.  Mountains rising out of the ocean, created by 1000's of years of erosion.  Starfish every were, a species i had yet to see.  The experience i feel is summed up in this capture that to this day truly speaks to me.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6eb03306e715f57c0450179d906d8192e6d99eb3.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Downtown Adventures]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Downtown Adventures</h1><p>Most people likely wouldn't think of a city as an outdoor landscape.  Yet i found out living in downtown Tampa Fl. a few years ago that they are indeed an ecosystem of their own.  I walked past this view as so many other in the bay side city.  As i was roaming the streets with my camera one summer evening i found a city empty and inviting. The sound was still and erie as the traffic lights blinked in their endless cycle as if there were cars waiting for that signal of progression.  I walked towards the sound of music in curiosity as to where it might be coming from.  To my surprise i stumbled onto the oldest bar in town playing jams on the jukebox which could be heard throughout the streets.  It was at this moment that i knew that the night was delivering me to unique moment that i had to capture.  with ony minimal editing the lights did amazing things in the heavy and humid air.  With a 6 minute exposure i achieved the reflection of the moment.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/556b4695ef4dc544861bf58fc2434ba51ca3097d.jpg"></article>]]></description>
