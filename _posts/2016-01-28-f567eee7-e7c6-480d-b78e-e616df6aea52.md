It was roughly 8 years ago as i walked out onto the beach on the Pacific northwest coast of Washington state.   I had to trek 2 miles through the tall magnificent forests of the Olympic Mountains.  As i stepped foot onto the beach i was in awe.  Mainly of the extreme tide drop...  litterally 10-15 feet.  It was like nothing i had ever seen.  Mountains rising out of the ocean, created by 1000's of years of erosion.  Starfish every were, a species i had yet to see.  The experience i feel is summed up in this capture that to this day truly speaks to me.
