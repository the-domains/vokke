To this day there is no where i have been that calls to me like my famies homestead farm in the north Georgia mountains.  It is a place that my whole childhood urned for.  It was a place of adventure, mystery, beauty and amazement.   My ancestors were homestead mountain people who lived of the land and with it.  Our heritage is rooted in growing and providing for ourselves.  My granny and pawpaw were big flower enthusiasts and could name the hundreds and hundreds of species and subspecies of flower on our farm.  This still amazes me today.  This is special image to me as it will always remind me of the walk up to the old house.
