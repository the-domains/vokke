On a cold and humid morning in the pine forests outside Bainbridge Ga. I walked out into this inspiring moment.  Taken on the start of  long day of working on the plantation.  I had just pulled up to the office when out back i looked upon a moment i had to stop and take in.  I grabbed my Canon and watched as the warm golden sun cut through the rising fog as if a blade through water.   Needless to say those days in that amazing place filled my soul with memories i will never forget.
