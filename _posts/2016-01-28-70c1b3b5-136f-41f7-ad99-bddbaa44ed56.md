The long trek up Mt. Washington in New Hampshire was worth the 7 hours of climbing and hiking when I came upon this breathtaking view.  As the clouds filled the cold sky i sat and listened to the sound of the earth singing.   The sound of wind, water, and earth all in sync.  the colors of fall filling the forest and painting a masterpiece of amazement.
