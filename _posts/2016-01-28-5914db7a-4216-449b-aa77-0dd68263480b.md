Most likely wouldn't think of a city as an outdoor landscape.  Yet i found out living in downtown Tampa Fl. a few years ago that they are indeed an ecosystem of their own.  I walked past this view as so many other in the bay side city.  As i was roaming the streets with my camera one summer evening i found a city empty and inviting. The sound was still and erie as the traffic lights blinked in their endless cycle as if there were cars waiting for that signal of progression.  I walked towards the sound of music in curiosity as to where it might be coming from.  To my surprise i stumbled onto the oldest bar in town playing jams on the jukebox which could be heard throughout the streets.  It was at this moment that i knew that the night was delivering me to unique moment that i had to capture.  with ony minimal editing the lights did amazing things in the heavy and humid air.  With a 6 minute exposure i achieved the reflection of the moment.
